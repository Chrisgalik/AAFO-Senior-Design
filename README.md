The Active Ankle Foot Orthosis (AAFO) will be utilized to aid in the movement for patients with impaired muscular control.

The AAFO will provide enough torque to supplement the motion of the ankle joint during walking movement.

This will be accomplished by using a binary control system to process signals from sensors to determine and control the output of the motor.

EMG sensors and FSR sensors will measure electrical activity and pressure in the leg and foot.

The microcontroller will interpret the signals and determine which stage of walking gait the user is in and supply corresponding motor control. 

The motor system, which acts as an artificial muscle, will move the joint by attaching to a rigid structure.
